Postmortem: The Great API Gateway Outage of 2024
Issue Summary
Duration: 1 hour and 30 minutes (11:00 PM - 12:30 AM Nigerian Time)
Impact: Complete outage of the API Gateway service, affecting all applications that rely on it. Users experienced error messages, slow load times, and intermittent service disruptions. Approximately 95% of our user base was impacted.
Root Cause: A misconfigured firewall rule on the API Gateway instance blocked incoming traffic from a significant portion of our user base.
Timeline
11:00 PM: The first customer complaint was received, reporting slow load times and intermittent errors.
11:15 PM: The engineering team was alerted to the issue and began investigating.
11:30 PM: Initial analysis indicated a network-related problem.
11:45 PM: The API Gateway instance was isolated for further investigation.
12:00 AM: A misconfigured firewall rule was identified as the root cause.
12:15 AM: The firewall rule was corrected, and the API Gateway service was restored.
12:30 AM: All affected applications were confirmed to be functioning normally.
Root Cause and Resolution
The outage was caused by a misconfigured firewall rule on the API Gateway instance. The rule, intended to block malicious traffic, inadvertently blocked legitimate traffic from a large number of users. This resulted in a significant reduction in the API Gateway's capacity, leading to the outage.
To resolve the issue, the misconfigured firewall rule was identified and corrected. The API Gateway instance was then restarted to apply the changes. Once the service was restored, all affected applications were verified to be functioning normally.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:
Review and strengthen firewall rules: All firewall rules will be reviewed to ensure they are accurate,necessary, and do not inadvertently block legitimate traffic.
Implement additional monitoring: More granular monitoring will be added to the API Gateway service to detect performance issues and anomalies early on.
Conduct regular security audits: Regular security audits will be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
Provide training to staff: Staff will receive training on best practices for configuring and managing firewall rules.
Implement a disaster recovery plan: A comprehensive disaster recovery plan will be developed to ensure that the API Gateway service can be quickly restored in the event of a major outage.
By implementing these measures, we will significantly reduce the risk of future outages and improve the overall reliability of our API Gateway service.
